## Business Problem
Accounts receivable (AR) is money owed to the business by its debtors or customers who have received a sales order or service on credit. For example: you receive electricity from your electric supplier but they bill you at end of month and then you pay in the following month. Most businesses whether big or small will have accounts receivable, and large enterprises have 100s of millions of dollars if not billions of dollars in AR on their balance sheets. Example: AR Balance for Apple Corp. ($365B in Revenue) runs around $26+ billion, see below. Even for a $1B in Revenue business, AR Balance can be often $250-350M. AR Balances on their own is not a business problem.
Late customer payments is a huge business problem since this affects cash flow. Payment services providers estimate that 93% of businesses experience late payments from customers. 47% of credit sales are paid late. On average, companies write off 1.5% of their receivables as bad debt. Payment default risk for overdue invoices increases rapidly after the first 30 days.
 
## Solution
In today's fast evolving market conditions, Finance needs an AR analytics application that has a machine learning model built-in to predict late payments, clear explanation of reasons (drivers) of late prediction, and automation that compels timely x-functional business action. The prediction will help strategize and take proactive steps; the explanation of prediction will augment human intelligence leading to better strategies and decisions; and, automation will automate notifications to AR Accountants and Sales Account Managers with relevant customer and payment data.
### Demo Components:

## Business Value Estimation
You can quantify 4 (distinct, non overlapping) business benefits of this solution: 
1.	Reduced Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)
2.	Reduced Bad Debt Write-offs  (huge problem in some industries like financial services, healthcare, utilities)
3.	Time savings for finance and sales chasing late payments
4.	Time savings in machine learning due to automation

You can look up the Accounts Receivable balance in the Balance Sheet Statement (e.g. shown below) in the Annual Report or Quarterly Report of a business. A significant increase in AR balance year-over-year (or quarter-over-quarter) might be due to late customer payments (good question to ask or discuss with customer.) Use the Benefits Calculator below to estimate value of business benefits.
